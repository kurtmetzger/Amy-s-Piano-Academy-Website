            &emsp; Amy has been our three daughters' piano teacher since 2018. Each of them started at age 6 
            and their progression has been remarkable. My daughters respond well to her teaching methods, 
            which are both engaging and effective, incorporating interactive techniques like sticker rewards 
            to keep the learning process fun.
            Moreover, Amy is always incredibly accommodating with scheduling, understanding the demands of our 
            girls' extracurricular activities. Her flexibility has been great. Overall, our girls have flourished 
            and we are grateful for Amy's invaluable contribution to their musical development.

            &emsp; Amy has taught piano to all four of our children, and we highly recommend her!  
            We have seen first-hand for over a decade that Amy has the patience and knowledge to teach 
            students of all ages, and she adapts her teaching to each child's learning style and interests.  
            We are continually impressed that studying piano with Amy gives our children knowledge and 
            appreciation of music and music theory beyond what is taught in their school music classes.

            &emsp; We are so glad that we found Amy's Piano Academy when we were searching for an 
            instructor to provide lessons for our son, and later our daughter. As they have 
            progressed over the years, she has done a great job of finding special pieces 
            that appeal to their individual interests and skill sets, which has really 
            helped make it fun for them and to keep them engaged in the learning process! 
            We really appreciate Amy's ability to adjust the pace of learning and the 
            exercises to each of our children's natural abilities, while still keeping 
            them challenged. Amy has also been very flexible when we have to juggle busy 
            schedules and move our planned lesson times around other event/practice conflicts. 
            We are excited to see how far our kids decide to go with their piano playing and we 
            know they are in good hands learning from Amy on this part of the journey!

            &emsp; Lessons with Mrs. Eisenhutt have been not just beneficial, but essential 
            to my musical career. I never set out to be a professional, rather merely 
            someone who is skilled enough to take pleasure in his own craft, and Mrs. Eisenhutt 
            helped me accomplish that goal. Mrs. Eisenhutt's priority with me was always clearly 
            to help me develop a talent, not to train a pro, and I have always been grateful for that. 
            She never pushed me too hard, was never disappointed when I forgot to do my theory assignment, 
            and always made sure it was about my enjoyment of the music. I learned music theory, I learned technique, 
            I learned sheet music, I learned to put emotion into my playing. In short, Mrs. Eisenhutt 
            taught me not just how to press the keys or to read the notes, but how to be a musician.

            &emsp; Mrs. Amy Eisenhutt has been a wonderful piano teacher for my children.  
            15 years ago I was looking for a piano teacher for my 5 year old son.  
            A friend recommended Mrs. Eisenhutt.  It was the best decision I made for both of my children.  
            She was gentle, kind, patient and understanding with my kids as they learned how to play the piano.  
            She understood when to push them to try harder pieces and she knew when to go slowly so 
            they could go at their own pace when learning a piece.  I have recommended Mrs. 
            Eisenhutt to many friends when they have asked for a piano teacher recommendation.  
            Not only is Mrs. Eisenhutt an excellent teacher, she is also an excellent accompanist and an 
            excellent person.  I highly recommend Mrs. Eisenhutt to anyone who would 
            like to learn how to play the piano.
